# Day 3 â€“ Directory Management & Permissions

## Commands Learned:
- `mkdir`: Create a folder
- `cd`: Move into a folder
- `cd ..`: Move out of a folder
- `pwd`: Print working directory
- `touch`: Create a file
- `ls -l`: Check permissions
- `chmod`: Change permissions

## What I Learned:
Today I created folders and files, navigated between them, and learned how Linux file permissions work. I also practiced changing permissions with `chmod`.
