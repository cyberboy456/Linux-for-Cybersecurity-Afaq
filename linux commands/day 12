# Day 13 â€“ sed, awk, and Redirection

## Commands Learned:
- `sed`: Stream editor for modifying files.
- `awk`: Useful for text scanning and reporting.
- `>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`: Redirection operators.

## What I Learned:
I practiced modifying file content using `sed` and extracting columns using `awk`. I also learned how redirection helps manage
output/input efficiently.
