# Day 12 â€“ Searching Files & Text

## Commands Learned:
- `find /path -name filename`: Search for files by name
- `locate filename`: Fast file search (database-based)
- `grep 'text' filename`: Search for text inside a file
- `grep -i`: Case-insensitive search
- `grep -n`: Show line numbers
- `grep -r`: Search inside all files in directory

## What I Learned:
I learned how to search for files using `find` and `locate`, and how to search inside files using `grep`. These are important tools for investigating systems in cybersecurity.
