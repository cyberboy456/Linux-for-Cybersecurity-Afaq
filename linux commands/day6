# Day 6 â€“ File Navigation & Wildcards

## Commands Learned:
- `cd`: Change directory
- `pwd`: Print current working directory
- `ls`: List directory contents
  - `ls -a`: Show hidden files
  - `ls -R`: Show contents recursively
  - `ls *.txt`: Use wildcard to list `.txt` files
- `find`: Search for files in directory hierarchy
  - Example: `find /home/afaq -name "*.sh"`
- `locate`: Quickly find files using a database
  - Requires `sudo updatedb` to update the index

## What I Learned:
Today I learned how to navigate through the file system using `cd`, `pwd`, and `ls`. I also explored how to use wildcards like `*`, `?`, and 
`[ ]` to search and match filenames. I practiced using `find` and `locate` commands to search for files, which are helpful tools in Linux and
very useful in cybersecurity tasks like system audits and malware investigations.
