# Day 9 â€“ Network Basics & Security

## ðŸ“š Commands Learned:

- `ifconfig` â€“ View network interfaces and IP configuration.
- `ip a` â€“ Modern alternative to `ifconfig`, shows detailed info.
- `ping <domain>` â€“ Check if a host is reachable.
- `netstat -tuln` â€“ View active TCP/UDP ports and listening services.
- `nslookup <domain>` â€“ Find IP addresses of domain names (DNS lookup).

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:

Today I explored basic networking tools used in Linux. I learned how to:
- View IP configuration using `ip a` and `ifconfig`.
- Test connection to websites using `ping`.
- Check open network ports with `netstat`.
- Use `nslookup` to resolve domain names to IPs.

These tools are essential in cybersecurity for understanding network layout, identifying vulnerabilities, and troubleshooting issues.
