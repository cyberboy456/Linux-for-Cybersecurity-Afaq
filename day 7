# Day 7 â€“ Understanding Process Management & System Monitoring

## Commands Learned:
- `ps`: Display active processes
- `top`: Real-time process viewer
- `htop`: Enhanced version of `top`
- `kill`: Terminate processes
- `killall`: Kill processes by name

## What I Learned:
Today I learned how to view and manage running processes in Linux. I practiced using `ps` to check running processes, `top` for real-time monitoring, and `htop` for an improved view. I also learned how to terminate processes with `kill` and `killall`. Understanding process management is crucial in ethical hacking for controlling system behavior, detecting rogue processes, and managing resources efficiently.
