# Day 5 â€“ File & Directory Permissions

## Commands Learned:
- `ls -l`: View file permissions in long list format
- `chmod`: Change file or folder permissions
- `chown`: Change file owner and group
- `umask`: View or set default permission mask for new files

## What I Learned:
Today I learned how Linux handles file and directory permissions. I practiced using `chmod` to set read, write, and execute rights using numeric values like 755. I also used `chown` to change ownership of files. I now understand how permission settings protect files and are a key part of cybersecurity.
